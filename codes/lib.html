            <P><h1 style="color:blue"><u>How it is evolving:-</u></h1></P>
            
            <P><pres>Much like everything else, lifting has also come a long way. We used to believe a lot of things that we now know to be complete lies. And we also know and understand things we thought were ludicrous before.

                And thatâ€™s normal.
                
                Research has evolved, lifting and bodybuilding have become more popular than ever, and in the informational era we in live today, every smart individual can get the right information to move forward.
                
                Make no mistake:
                
                There still is a lot of misinformation and crap out there, and I and many others have taken it as a personal challenge to help get rid of it bit by bit.
                
                Today, there are thousands of awesome people out there who are dedicated to spreading legit information on nutrition, training, supplementation and more without asking for anything in return.
                
                And to that end, I decided to compile this list of posts from the web into one tidy guide for you to enjoy.</pres></P>

                    <center><h2><q></i>Why Aren't We Motivated to Exercise?</q></h2></center>
                    <pres><b>There are lots of reasons we may not be as motivated to exercise as we used to be. Some of these things are actually barriers or obstacles we have to overcome, such as:</b></pres><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul >
                        <li><mark><h2>Sedentary jobs and lifestyles:</h2></mark><pres> Most of us spend much of our day on the computer and in the car, meaning less walking and more sitting. The more we sit, the more we get used to sitting, and the harder it is to get the body moving.</pres></li><br>
                        <li><mark><h2>Being overweight:</h2></mark><pres>If you're overweight, it's harder to exercise. You might have physical issues like joint pain or injuries and it's hard to move a larger body, making exercise more intimidating and uncomfortable.</pres></li>
                        <li><mark><h2>Busy lifestyle</h2></mark><pres>We are busier than ever and that becomes a great excuse to skip exercise. </pres></li>
                        <li><mark><h2>stress</mark></h2><pres>While exercise is supposed to reduce stress, exercise is also a kind of stress on the body. If you feel stressed out, working out may be the last thing you want to do, even though it's probably the best thing for you.</pres></li>
                        <li><mark><h2>Access to workout facilities:</h2></mark><pres>If you don't have a gym or community center nearby, that may influence whether you work out on a regular basis. </pres></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><u><mark>The world we live</mark></u> in doesn't make it easy to exercise. On the other hand, there are more ways to exercise than ever before. We have fitness apps, on-demand workouts, and live streaming classes. CrossFit boxes, small-group personal training, and outdoor bootcamp classes are widely available along with traditional gyms, studios, and health clubs.</h3>
